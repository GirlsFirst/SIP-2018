To run:

1. Open in Arduino.
1. Plug in robot using USB.
1. Verify code.
1. Upload program to robot.

This program uses a piezo as input to make a "catbot" move when the piezospeaker is tapped (knock sensor).

**Note:** Student solutions may choose to use other sensors besides the piezo as an input. You may need to calibrate your piezo, based on your resistor, by changing the threshold value. Piezos require being plugged in positive/negative in a specific direction (like LEDs).
