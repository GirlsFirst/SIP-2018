# Unit 2.1: Robotics

## Table of Contents

### Projects:

1. [Let There Be Light: Part 2](LetThereBeLight-Pt2)
    * This project is used in U2L1.
    * Students learn how to write an Arduino C program and how to use the commands `pinMode()`, `delay()`, and `digitalWrite()`.
1. [Let There Be Light: Part 3](LetThereBeLight-Pt3)
    * This project is used in U2L1.
    * Students learn how to use functions and variables in Arduino C.
1. [Robot Dance Party](RobotDanceParty)
    * This project is used in U2L2.
    * Students learn how to read circuit diagrams, declare and call functions in Arduino C, and use loops.
1. [Whisker Input Code ALong](WhiskerCodeAlong)
    * This project is used in U2L3.
    * Students learn how to use an input with the teacher by coding the whisker sensor.
1. [Build a Circuit](BuildACircuit)
    * This project is used in U2L3.
    * Students learn how to plug in and code an input using just the circuit diagram.
1. [Here Kitty Kitty](HereKittyKitty)
    * This project is used in U2L3.
    * Students get creative with inputs. They use a sensor to move a cat robot forward.
1. [Escape Bot](EscapeBot)
    * This project is used in U2L4.
    * Students learn AI development by creating a robot that can escape from a three-sided box.
