# Robot Dance Party

1. The program begins by setting up the pins to control the various devices, and a declaration of frequencies for different notes to use with the piezo.
1. Next there are 3 functions that are defined: one for a dance move (twirlStopShake()), for an LED pattern (ledSwirl()), and for a short song (piezoGreeting()).
1. Finally the program will loop through these 3 functions.

If students want the LED and dance to happen simultaneously and not sequentially, they will have to combine the commands for the dance moves and LED pattern into a single function.
